My translation of "Ray Tracing in one Weekend" to FreeBASIC.
Folders contain "milestone" releases.

Some of the functions are imported from my 2016 path tracer and are different.
 
 currently:

Scattering - my own technique which coveres perfect mirror to perfect lambertian surfaces



Note:  Glossy scenes look more vibrant compiled under GCC -O 2 or 3
